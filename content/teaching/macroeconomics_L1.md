## Content

The Macroeconomics I course introduces first-year students to the core concepts used to analyze the economy as a whole. It covers key macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, and economic growth. Students study the functioning of markets at the aggregate level and the roles of households, firms, governments, and central banks. The course also examines fiscal and monetary policies and their effects on economic activity. Basic macroeconomic models are introduced to explain short-run fluctuations and long-run growth. By the end of the course, students are able to interpret economic data and understand major macroeconomic issues and policy debates.
